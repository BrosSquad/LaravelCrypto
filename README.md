# Laravel General Hashing
> Wrapper classes for common hashing functions

## Introduction

Many web applications use some kind of cryptography, but most programmers do not know what algorithm to use.

There are a lot of choices, but most of them are terrible these days **(Looking at MD4 and MD5)**. Most of the good
functions have really confusing API (like libsodium), so I wanted a clean "Laravel Way" and OOP access to these API's. 
 I chose to write Laravel library (because Laravel is most commonly used php framework) that will help programmers
  (especially new ones) when they need cryptography.
  
This library provides **Hashing** and **Signature** algorithms with easy to use API.
